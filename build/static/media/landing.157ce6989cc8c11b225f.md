I'm an aspiring software engineer and current [CSE](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/programs/computer-science-eng/) student at The Unviersity of Michigan. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher through my school, developing simulations for moon phobos rovers. I'm very interested in full-stack development, parallel processing, and the rapidly growing field of AI/ML.

I'm currently working with,

-   React (JS/TS)
-   SQLite
-   Flask (Python)
-   Project Chrono (C++)
-   HTML/CSS
-   Build systems
