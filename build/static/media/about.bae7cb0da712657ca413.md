‚Üê Intel Museum, Santa Clara, CA

As a second-year computer science student, I am working to find a specialization that aligns with my interests and strengths. I hope to secure a software engineering internship for the summer of 2025, where I can contribute to advanced projects and collaborate with a strong team.

Outside of tech, I'm a sports enthusiast, a retired hockey player, and enjoy weightlifting and traveling. My experience in the food service industry has inspired an interest in cooking and meeting new people, and I'm excited to expand my international travels after graduation.
