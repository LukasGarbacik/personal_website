‚Üê Intel Museum, Santa Clara, CA

As an incoming third-year computer science student, I have begun to explore deeper into the fields I am more interested in. I plan to take more upper level classes in parallel processing and distributed systems, as well as continue independent project work, such as my more recent Rust project. Additionally, I am a math person at heart, and I will be taking the highly recommended Machine Learning (EECS 445), and finishing my math minor in the fall. 

Outside of tech, I'm a sports enthusiast, a retired hockey player, and enjoy weightlifting and traveling. My experience in the food service industry has inspired an interest in cooking and meeting new people, and I'm excited to expand my international travels after graduation.
