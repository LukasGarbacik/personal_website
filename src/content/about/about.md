I am a third-year computer science student and have begun to specialize in parallel systems and data-driven computing. I have taken upper level classes such as Machine Learning (EECS 445) and Web Systems (EECS 485) to expand my skills with the foundations of these topics. My research over the past two years has grown my interest in low level programming, and my course-focus during the winter semester will be just that. With six-credit Operating Systems (EECS 482) and Applied Parallel Processing with GPU's (EECS 471), I am looking to solidify my software and architectural understanding. I am continuing my search for an internship position this upcoming summer 2026, before my senior year and graduation. 

Outside of tech, I'm a sports enthusiast, a retired hockey player, and enjoy weightlifting and traveling. My experience in the food service industry has inspired an interest in cooking and meeting new people, and I'm excited to expand my international travels in the near future.
