‚Üê Intel Museum, Santa Clara, CA

As an incoming third-year computer science student, I have begun to explore deeper into the fields I am more interested in. I am now taking upper level classes involving systems level programming, and integrating high level mathematics into projects, such as in  Machine Learning (EECS 445) right now. My main goal is to work as a SWE intern at a reputable company this upcoming summer 2026; contributing my experience to a high level project team.

Outside of tech, I'm a sports enthusiast, a retired hockey player, and enjoy weightlifting and traveling. My experience in the food service industry has inspired an interest in cooking and meeting new people, and I'm excited to expand my international travels after graduation.
